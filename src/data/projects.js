The ECA Costume Show 2020 was cancelled due to the pandemic so Hannah decided to make a video of her costumes in her local forest as an alternative way to show them. Watch a video of this project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UX1dSzNvqQ) !\n\nThe inspiration for the costumes was a book that Hannah wrote called 'Journey'. In the format of a continuous poem, the book tells the story of Hannah walking barefoot through her forest at home. She describes all of the sensations that she experienced: scents, sights, sounds and the different textures felt under her feet; some nice, some painful. During her walk, she also found objects, plants or animals that she took close-up photographs of and had wonderful imaginings of a miniature human interacting with these things. She created these imaginings visually in photographic form and they appear in the book at the points where they were spotted along the journey. With each image there is a short poem that she wrote to tell a taster of a story about the miniature person's experience. The costumes were inspired by the natural textures found in each photograph. The pages of the book are the paper gills of a mushroom. She created this mushroom structure in order to present the book as a natural form; in homage to the forest (see images below).` },

It will be dramatic, comedic and engaging. I have brought the story into the present day and have added a magical feel to it. I am portraying the story with a message to take care of nature as humankind is currently killing off nature at a devastating rate.\n\nThe dwarves are now nymphs and are played by children. Their costumes are each inspired by one type of tree that resonates with their character, for example: Sneezy's costume is inspired by a birch tree with pollen catkins on it that make him sneeze. Snow White's costume is inspired by a snowdrop flower. I am renaming her Snowdrop and she represents nature. The evil Queen is renamed Machine Queen and she represents the industrial aspects of humankind and all of the pollution and devastation that humans have caused to nature.\n\nThe Machine Queen disguises herself as an old witch in order to fool Snowdrop into eating a poisoned vegan sausage (because that is possibly the most manmade food there is and it is a fun idea!) Will Snowdrop fall for the Queen's trickery this time round? Or will nature rise above the poisons of humankind's existence once and for allâ€¦?` },

We also had living plants in the set which gave a uniquely organic, intimate feel to the performance. The children from the hospital made woven 'wishes' and, during the show, the audience were invited to hang the wishes on the trees that we had woven out of willow.\n\nDuring the performance, Christina invited a young girl from the hospital to do a short dance duet with her. This lovely detail tied the whole piece together. It was a truly beautiful and heartfelt performance that touched the hearts of many and shone a light on the remarkable young kids at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.\n\nAs designer assistant, I wrote a reflection paper with designer Mona Kastell on 'Glimpsing Air Pockets' that has been published in the peer reviewed journal Scene.\n\n [Kastell, M. and Myers, H.
