In November I was still animating with the three schools and then editing some of Kyle primary’s animations on my computer with them. One group wrote a whole script and did amusing voice overs for their characters. We were all in fits of laughter whilst recording the voices! Our faces hurt from laughing! x) 

Once each group had finished their animations I invited the children to play instruments and make sounds so I could record them to go with their animated story. A few of them are very talented piano players! And one group made their own catchy electronic tune on Chrome Music Lab.

Once the editing was finished, we did technical run throughs to check the sound on the big speakers with the big projector screens. Then we had the animations showings! (One in each school.) Every group’s animations were so unique and their parents and teachers were very proud of them. I’m so grateful that I got to do this project with the children. : ) 

See below the three animation videos from the three primary schools: Kyle, Loch Duich and Auchtertyre. Enjoy!
